      <description>In this lesson on Data Scientology we will be constructing a bar plot on the 1980 MLB Team Homerun Distribution.
First, like always, we must upload necessary libraries needed to perform the time series function. The three libraries we need are as follows:
library(Lahman) library(sqldf) library(ggplot2) Next, we must execute a query to extract the data we want to create a bar plot on. We want to see how many homeruns each MLB team totaled in 1980.</description>

      <description>Welcome back to Data Scientology. Today we will be looking at how to create a time series plot on some Babe Ruthâ€™s HR career homerun totals.
First, like always, we must upload necessary libraries needed to perform the time series function. The three libraries we need are as follows:
library(Lahman) library(sqldf) library(ggplot2) Next, we must execute a query to extract the data we want to create a time-series plot on. We want each year Babe Ruth played in the MLB and we also want his homerun totals.</description>

      <description>Welcome back to Data Scientology. Today we will be looking at how to create a scatterplot on MLB career homerun totals versus career strikeouts.
First, like always, we must upload necessary libraries needed to perform the time series function. The three libraries we need are as follows:
library(Lahman) library(sqldf) library(ggplot2) Next, we must execute a query to extract the data we want to create a scatterplot on. We want to select all players by playerID, their homerun totals and strikeout totals.</description>
